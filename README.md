An all-in-one docker-compose deployment is provided, which includes the following components:
- Traefik - edge proxy that is responsible for external traffic routing and internal grpc load-balancing. 
- [account service](https://github.com/minghsu0107/saga-account) - service that handles login, sigup, authentication, and token management.
- [purchase service](https://github.com/minghsu0107/saga-purchase) - service that creates purchase and streams results of each saga step.
- [transaction services](https://github.com/minghsu0107/saga-product)
  - product service - service that creates and checks products; updates product inventories.
  - order service - service that creates and queries orders.
  - payment service - service that creates and queries payments.
  - orchestrator service - **stateless** saga orchestrator.
- Local databases
  - Account database (MySQL 8.0)
  - Product database (MySQL 8.0)
  - Payment database (MySQL 8.0)
  - Order database (MySQL 8.0)
- Six-node redis cluster - in-memory cache for account information and product details.
- Observibility
  - Prometheus - pulling metrics from all services.
  - Opencensus collector - collecting tracing spans accross service boundaries.
  - Jaeger - preserveing and querying tracing spans.
- NATS Streaming - message broker for saga events and streaming results.
## Usage
To run all services locally via docker-compose, execute:
```bash
./run.sh run
```
This will bootsrap all services as well as their replicas in Docker containers.

To stop all services, execute:
```bash
./run.sh stop
```
### Account Service
First, we need to signup a new user:
```bash
curl -X POST localhost/api/auth/signup \
    --data '{"password":"abcd5432","firstname":"ming","lastname":"hsu","email":"ming@ming.com","address":"taipei","phone_number":"1234567"}'
```
User account login:
```bash
curl -X POST localhost/api/auth/login \
    --data '{"email":"ming@ming.com","password":"abcd5432"}'
```
This will return a new token pair (refresh token + access token). We should provide the access token in the `Authorization` header for those APIs with authentication.

We could obtain a new token pair by refreshing with the refresh token:
```bash
curl -X POST localhost/api/auth/refresh \
    --data '{"refresh_token":"<refresh_token>"}'
```
Get user account information:
```bash
curl localhost/api/info/account -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>"
```
Update user account information:
```bash
curl -X PUT localhost/api/info/account -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>" \
    --data '{"firstname":"newfirst","lastname":"newlast","email":"ming3@ming.com"}'
```
Get user shipping information:
```bash
curl localhost/api/info/shipping -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>"
```
Update user shipping information:
```bash
curl -X PUT localhost/api/info/shipping -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>" \
    --data '{"address":"japan","phone_number":"54321"}'
```
### Product Service
Next, let's create some new products:
```bash
curl -X POST localhost/api/product \
     --data '{"name": "product1","description":"first product","brand_name":"mingbrand","price":100,"inventory":1000}'
curl -X POST localhost/api/product \
     --data '{"name": "product2","description":"second product","brand_name":"mingbrand","price":100,"inventory":10}'
```
The API will return the ID of the created product.

List all products with pagination:
```bash
curl "localhost/api/products?offset=0&size=100"
```
This will return a list of product catalog, including its ID, name, price, and current inventory.

Get product details:
```bash
curl "localhost/api/product/<product_id>"
```
This will return the name, description, brand, price and cached inventory of the queried product.
### Purchase Service
Here comes the core part. We are going to create a new purchase, which sends a new purchase event to the saga orchestrator and triggers distributed transactions.
```bash
curl -X POST localhost/api/purchase -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>" \
    --data '{"purchase_items":[{"product_id":<product_id>,"amount":1}],"payment":{"currency_code":"NT"}}'
```

After creating a purchase, we could subscribe to `/api/purchase/result` to receive **realtime transaction results**. The purchase service pushes results using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events). The following code example shows how to subscribe to server-sent events using Javascript. We will use [this library](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource) to send SSE request with `Authorization` header.

```javascript
var script = document.createElement('script');script.src = "https://unpkg.com/event-source-polyfill@1.0.9/src/eventsource.js";document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
var es = new EventSourcePolyfill('http://localhost/api/purchase/result', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'bearer <access_token>'
  },
});
var listener = function (event) {
  var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(data);
};
es.addEventListener("data", listener);
```

If the subscription is successful, we would receive realtime results like the following:

### Order Service
Next, we could check whether our order is successfully created:
```bash 
curl "localhost/api/order/<payment_id>"  -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>"
```
### Payment Service
Finally, we could check whether our payment is successfully created:
```bash
curl "localhost/api/payment/<payment_id>"  -H "Authorization: bearer <access_token>"
```
## Observibility
All services could be configured to expose Prometheus metrics and send tracing spans. By default, all services have their Prometheus metric endpoints exposed on port `8080`. As for distributed tracing, we could simply enable it by setting environment variable `OC_AGENT_HOST` to the address of our Opencensus collector.

Visit the Jaeger web UI at `http://localhost:16686`. We can see all tracing spans of our API calling chains, starting from Traefik. For example, the following figure shows a request that queries `/api/order/<order_id>`. We can see that once order service receives the request, it authenticates the request first by calling `auth.AuthService.Auth`, a gRPC authentication API provided by account service. If the authentication is successful, order service will continue processing the request. To obtain a complete order, order service will ask product service for details of purchased products through another gRPC call `product.ProductService.GetProducts`.

Let's see a more complexed example. This figure shows how transaction services interact with each other after we create a new purchase. The authentication process is similar to the previous example. After purchase service authenticates the request successfully, it publishes a `CreatePurchaseCmd` event to the message broker. Orchestrator service will then receive the event and start saga transactions.

Here comes the interesting part. Each transaction service adds the current span context to the event before publishing it. When a subscriber receives a new event, it extracts the span context from the event payload. This extracted span then becomes the parent span of the current span. By doing this, we could generate a full pub/sub calling chain across all transactions.

In addition, Jaeger will create service topologies for our spans. The following figure shows the topology when a client creates a new purchase.
